this.path News

CHANGES IN this.path devel:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * this.path() is now compatible with function utils::Sweave().

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

    * set.sys.path.jupyter() is defunct and should be replaced with
      set.jupyter.path().

    * fileArgs() is defunct and should be replaced with progArgs().

  BUG FIXES:

    * this.path() now works correctly in the site-wide startup profile
      file.

    * this.path() now works correctly with source file aliases.

    * Updated shFILE() to work better with older versions of R.

    * Improved LINENO(), specifically sys.LINENO(), when comparing
      paths to determine the appropriate source reference.

    * this.proj() now throws an error that it does not work for URL
      pathnames.

    * Removed the restriction that reset.proj() could only be called
      from a top level context.

    * withArgs() will now be found anywhere on the stack as long as it
      and the source()-like function are called in the same frame.

      e.g. withArgs(try(source("./example.R")), 1, 2, 3) now works as
      intended.

    * Unified behaviour of is.main() across all GUIs.

    * All promises are now braced, giving a more sensible call stack in
      case of warnings / / errors.

    * Namespaces loaded with requireNamespace() are now loaded quietly.

CHANGES IN this.path 2.3.1 (2023-12-10):

  BUG FIXES:

    * sys.srcref() now works when passed as a non-forced argument to a
      function containing source references. By extension, this.path()
      and LINENO() now work as well.

CHANGES IN this.path 2.3.0 (2023-12-02):

  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:

    * Previously defunct functions this.path2(), this.dir2(),
      this.dir3(), and normalized.shFILE() were removed entirely.

  NEW FEATURES:

    * this.path() is now compatible with GUI 'Emacs'.

CHANGES IN this.path 2.2.0 (2023-10-29):

  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:

    * Active bindings 'FILE' and 'LINE' have been converted to regular
      bindings 'FILE()' and 'LINE()' after the unfortunate realization
      that active binding functions are always evaluated in the global
      environment.

  NEW FEATURES:

    * this.path() works significantly better with source references.

    * this.path() is now compatible with 'package:targets'.

    * Added with_site.file() and with_init.file() that allow
      this.path() to be used within the site-wide startup profile file
      or a user profile.

    * this.path(contents = TRUE) in 'Rgui' will now return the contents
      of an unsaved document, or return the unsaved changes of a saved
      document.

    * Added set.gui.path() for implementing sys.path() for arbitrary
      GUIs.

CHANGES IN this.path 2.1.0 (2023-09-12):

  NEW FEATURES:

    * this.path() is now compatible with function shiny::runApp().

    * this.path() is now compatible with function plumber::plumb().

    * Added tryCatch3() which accepts condition expressions instead of
      condition handlers. Added active binding 'last.condition' which
      will be the last thrown-and-caught condition in tryCatch3().

    * When tryCatch2() and tryCatch3() catch a condition but the
      respective handler / / expression is missing, the next
      non-missing handler / / expression is used instead.

  BUG FIXES:

    * set.env.path() and set.src.path() now return their input instead
      of returning NULL.

    * set.src.path() now accepts an expression vector containing a
      source file.

CHANGES IN this.path 2.0.0 (2023-08-08):

  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:

    * this.path() was misleading users into believing it returns the
      path of the script in which it is written. In actuality, it
      returns the path of the executing script. As such, it was renamed
      to sys.path() in accordance with the other call stack inspection
      functions sys.call(), sys.frame(), sys.nframe(), and
      sys.function(). Related functions that were renamed:

              old                    new
        [1,]  this.dir               sys.dir
        [2,]  here                   sys.here
        [3,]  this.proj              sys.proj
        [4,]  rel2here               rel2sys.dir
        [5,]  LINENO                 sys.LINENO
        [6,]  try.this.path          try.sys.path
        [7,]  set.this.path          set.sys.path
        [8,]  unset.this.path        unset.sys.path
        [9,]  set.this.path.jupyter  set.sys.path.jupyter

      this.path() was replaced by a function that returns the path of
      the script in which it is written. It does this by looking for a
      source reference with an appropriate source file, or inspects the
      environment in which it is called for an associated path, or
      returns the path of the executing script, as before. Related
      functions that were replaced:

        [1]  this.dir   here        ici            this.proj
        [5]  rel2here   LINENO      try.this.path  check.path
        [9]  check.dir  check.proj

  NEW FEATURES:

    * Added env.path() for determining the path associated with the top
      level environment. Also added env.dir(), env.here(), env.proj(),
      rel2env.dir(), env.LINENO(), and try.env.path().

    * Added src.path() for determining the path associated with its
      source reference. Also added src.dir(), src.here(), src.proj(),
      rel2src.dir(), src.LINENO(), and try.src.path().

    * Added set.env.path() and set.src.path() to work along side
      set.sys.path().

    * this.path() now accepts arguments 'n', 'envir', 'matchThisEnv',
      and 'srcfile' to finely control how the path will be retrieved.

    * Added rel2proj() for turning absolute paths into relative paths
      against the script's project root. Also added rel2sys.proj(),
      rel2env.proj(), and rel2src.proj().

    * set.sys.path() now accepts argument 'ofile' specifying the
      original file argument. This overwrites the value returned by
      sys.path(original = TRUE).

    * Added active bindings 'FILE' and 'LINE' linking to
      try.this.path() and LINENO() to be used in a similar manner to
      the macros '__FILE__' and '__LINE__' in C.

    * Added path.functions() which accepts a file path and constructs a
      set of path-related functions, similar to this.path() and
      associated.

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

    * inside.source() and set.this.path() are defunct and should be
      replaced with set.sys.path().

    * unset.this.path() is defunct and should be replaced with
      unset.sys.path().

    * set.this.path.jupyter() is defunct and should be replaced with
      set.sys.path.jupyter().

    * reset.this.proj() is defunct and should be replaced with
      reset.proj().

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fixed display issues in LaTeX and plain text documentation.

    * reset.proj() now has environment
      <environment: namespace:this.path> as do all other exported
      functions.

    * Fixed sys.path(contents = TRUE) in 'RStudio' and 'VSCode' having
      a trailing blank string.

    * Fixed sys.path(contents = TRUE) in 'Jupyter' if the executing
      script had yet to be determined.

    * Fixed sys.path(original = NA) in 'RStudio', 'VSCode', and
      'Jupyter' saying 'missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed'.

    * Fixed relpath() on Windows when comparing paths with network
      shares.

    * Fixed 'this.path' used in the site-wide startup profile file, a
      user profile, or the function .First() on Windows in 'RStudio'.
