CHANGES IN this.path 0.8.0:

  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:

    * All previously defunct functions were removed entirely.

  NEW FEATURES:

    * this.path, this.dir, shFILE, and normalized.shFILE now have
      argument default that will be evaluated and returned if there is
      no executing script or command line argument FILE was not found.

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

    * this.path2(), this.dir2(), and this.dir3() are deprecated and
      should be replaced by this.path(default = NULL),
      this.dir(default = NULL), and this.dir(default = getwd()),
      respectively.

  BUG FIXES:

    * normalized.shFILE() no longer sets attribute
      "this.path.from.shell", that is now handled by this.path.
