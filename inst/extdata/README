In Rgui for Windows, this.path() works by looking at the windows
handles belonging to that R process.

For an open script, the windows handle will end with " - R Editor" OR
ANY SUPPORTED TRANSLATION INTO ANOTHER LANGUAGE . For a new script, the
windows handle will be "Untitled - R Editor", again possibly translated
into another language.

What we do in "write-r-editor.R" is:

  * launch a new Rgui process in each supported language

  * open an existing script and grab the translations of " - R Editor"
    in that language

  * open a new script and grab the whole windows handle

This process is automated by a python script that types automatically for us.

We will then save that information into files "r-editor.txt" and
"untitled.txt".

In "main.R", we run "write-r-editor.R" for both ucrt and non-ucrt
R sessions (since the translations are different between the two).
